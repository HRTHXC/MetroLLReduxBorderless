This little mod (can you call it that?), creates a faux Borderless Windowed
mode for Metro LL Redux, but could be modified easily for other troublesome
applications that have trouble with tabbing out of the application.

For those running with the taskbar at the top like me, this is great.

Inside are the following:
metroborderless.exe
windowMode.exe

Installation:
Place these files in the root game directory of Metro Last Light Redux
Point Steam to run "metroborderless.exe" instead of "metro.exe" (no quotation)
When run, once the window shows the application bar, it has finished running.

Notes:
Steam helps with it's game overlay in terms of pressing Shift+TAB to then regain mouse control.

Sample run:
